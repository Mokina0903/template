This repository contains tools for quickly setting up your own __Aardvark__ project. All [aardvark.rendering](https://github.com/vrvis/aardvark.rendering) packages are automatically referenced to start developing straight away.

To create a new project run __build.cmd__ or __build.sh__ and follow the instructions.

A __visual studio solution__ inclusive project file is generated.

After successfully setting up your project, __build.cmd__ or __build.sh__ triggers our [build script](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/Aardvark.Fake)
