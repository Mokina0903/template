This repository contains tools for quickly setting up your own __Aardvark__ project. [aardvark.rendering](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.rendering), [aardvark.media](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.media) [aardvark.base](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.base) packages are already referenced. Start developing interactive visualization apps straight away!

To create a new project run __build.cmd__ or __build.sh__ and follow the instructions.

A __visual studio solution__ inclusive project file is generated.

After successfully setting up your project, __build.cmd__ or __build.sh__ triggers our [build script](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/Aardvark.Fake).
