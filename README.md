This repository is part of the open-source [Aardvark platform](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.docs/wiki) for visual computing, real-time graphics and visualization.

This template contains tools for quickly setting up your own interactive visualization __Aardvark__ app.

To create a new project run __build.cmd__ or __build.sh__ and follow the instructions.

A __visual studio solution__ inclusive project file is generated.

After successfully setting up your project, __build.cmd__ or __build.sh__ triggers our [build script](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/Aardvark.Fake).

## Aardvark Platform
Our **quickstart** for [Windows](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.docs/wiki/Quickstart-Windows) and [Linux](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.docs/wiki/Quickstart-Linux) smoothes the path for your Aardvark experience! 

Do not forget to checkout our [wiki](https://github.com/aardvarkplatform/aardvark.docs/wiki) and various [examples](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.docs), where your contriubtion is very welcomed!
