This repository contains tools for quickly setting up a project which automatically already references all aardvark.rendering packages. The procedure is as follows:
 * clone this repository
 * run build.cmd or build.sh
 * an interactive setup tool will ask you for your project name etc
 * the script automatically creates project files and a visual studio solution
 * after the script terminates you should be set to use normal build process:
    - run build.cmd or build.sh again
    - start developing
